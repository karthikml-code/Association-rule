We will discuss the Apriori algorithm here. 
Three main things we need to do in Apriori algorithm. 
1) Apriori - support
2) Apriori - confidence
3) Apriori - lift

Apriori - algorithm steps:
1) set a minimu support and confidence
2) take all subsets in transactions having higher support than minimum support
3) take all the rules of these subsets having higher confidence than minimum confidence
4) sort the rules by decreasing lift
